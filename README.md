Abie was first released on March 5th, 2017 with the outstanding contribution of the [Ethergency](https://twitter.com/ethergency) team at [Hacker House Paris](http://www.hackerhouse.paris/).

## Intro

Abie is a DAO that includes a voting system and a Sybil-resistant membership system. Only the vote of the members can trigger a transaction to the beneficiary. The 'liquid democracy' allows members that don't have any device or Internet access to express their opinion on each incoming proposal.
