# Abie

Abie was first released on March 5th, 2017 with the contribution of the [Ethergency](https://twitter.com/ethergency) team at [Hacker House Paris](http://www.hackerhouse.paris/).

## Intro

Abie is a DAO that includes a voting system and a Sybil-resistant membership system. Only the vote of the members can trigger a transaction to the beneficiary. The 'liquid democracy' allows members that don't have any device or Internet access to express their opinion on each incoming proposal.

## Run

```
npm i
npm start
```

In your browser:

* Make sure that your Metamask is up and logged to Kovan
* Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Click on `Search`.

You can: 

* Submit a proposal
* Vote (members only)
* Count the votes
* Claim a proposal

## Deployment

Don't do that if you don't know what you're doing. The team can't be held  liable or responsible for any damage which results from wild use of [Abie.sol](https://github.com/AbieFund/abie/blob/master/contracts/Abie.sol).

To deploy your own DAO, you can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org).

* Copy the contract address and paste it in the app
* You can convert your string [here](https://codebeautify.org/string-hex-converter), then add a `0x` right before your converted string.
* Do the same for the `statement`.
* Now the `deploy` field should look like this:

`"0x4162696520446576","0x57652077616e7420746f207465737420416269652e",["<your addr>","<another member addr>","0x24cfc8f7ff347c158e6f06c37e94525892b4df44","0xeefb9234302128259d46ed9e223fbc48b5edb5d1"]`

To learn more about that, a complete tutorial is available on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/AbieFund/abie/wiki/Abie-Wiki).

## Next step

We're getting ready to deploy 2 pilots: Abie Dev (See the [1st proposal](https://abiefund.consider.it/abie-dev-first-proposal) and Abie Sting.
